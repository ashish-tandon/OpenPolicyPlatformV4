  retries: 3           # Current: 3
  start_period: 45s    # Current: 45s

# Optimized configuration
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "appropriate-command"]
  interval: 30s        # Optimized: 30s (less frequent)
  timeout: 10s         # Optimized: 10s (adequate)
  retries: 3           # Keep: 3 (reasonable)
