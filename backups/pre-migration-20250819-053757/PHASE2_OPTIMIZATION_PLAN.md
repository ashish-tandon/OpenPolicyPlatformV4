## 🔍 **CURRENT ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: Health Check Status for Web & Gateway**
**Problem**: Health checks show "starting" status even though services are working
**Root Cause**: Process-based health checks may not be detecting the correct processes
**Solution**: Implement more reliable health check methods

**Immediate Action**: Test alternative health check approaches
```bash
# Test web service process detection
docker exec openpolicy-core-web ps aux | grep -E "(node|vite|npm)"

# Test gateway service process detection  
docker exec openpolicy-core-gateway ps aux | grep nginx
```

### **Issue 2: Health Check Optimization**
**Problem**: Health checks may be too frequent or resource-intensive
**Solution**: Optimize health check intervals and methods

**Optimization Plan**:
- Reduce health check frequency for stable services
- Use lightweight health check methods
- Implement progressive health check intervals

---

## 🚀 **OPTIMIZATION IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Week 1: Health Check & Stability (Current)**
- **Days 1-2**: Fix health check issues for all services

### **Week 2: Performance Optimization**
- **Days 1-3**: API performance optimization
- **Days 4-5**: Database query optimization
- **Days 6-7**: Cache and gateway optimization

---

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE OPTIMIZATION ACTIONS**

### **Action 1: Health Check Investigation**
```bash
# Investigate web service processes
docker exec openpolicy-core-web ps aux

# Investigate gateway service processes
docker exec openpolicy-core-gateway ps aux

# Check service logs for health check issues
docker-compose -f docker-compose.core.yml logs web
docker-compose -f docker-compose.core.yml logs gateway
```

### **Action 2: Alternative Health Check Methods**
- **Web Service**: Use HTTP endpoint health check instead of process check
- **Gateway Service**: Use Nginx status endpoint instead of process check
- **API Service**: Keep database connectivity check (working well)
- **Database Services**: Keep current checks (working perfectly)

### **Action 3: Health Check Configuration Optimization**
```yaml
# Optimized health check configuration
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "appropriate-health-check-command"]
  interval: 30s        # Less frequent for stable services
  timeout: 10s         # Adequate timeout
  retries: 3           # Reasonable retry count
  start_period: 60s    # Sufficient startup time
```
