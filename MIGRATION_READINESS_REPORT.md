# Migration Readiness Report

**Generated**: $(date)
**Repository**: OpenPolicyPlatformV4
**Migration Type**: Monorepo to 6-Layer Architecture

## Environment Check

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Git installed and configured
- [ ] GitHub CLI installed and authenticated
- [ ] Azure CLI installed and authenticated
- [ ] Docker installed and running
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Node.js 16+ installed

### Repository Status
- **Total Services**: 45+ components
- **Architecture**: Monolith transitioning to microservices
- **Current State**: Mixed (some services in /services, others scattered)

## Layer Distribution Plan

### Infrastructure Layer (15 services)

- Database, Cache, Message Queue
- Logging Stack (ELK)
- Background Processing (Celery)

### Data Layer (8 services)
- ETL, Data Management, Scrapers
- Policy Engine, Search, File Management

### Business Layer (10 services)
- Committees, Representatives, Votes, Debates
- Analytics, Reporting, Dashboard
- Workflow, Integration

### Frontend Layer (3 services)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Service interdependencies
- Data migration complexity
- Authentication across layers

### Medium Risk
- Performance impact
- Network latency between layers
- Configuration management

### Low Risk
- Technology stack (well-established)
- Team expertise
- Rollback procedures

## Next Steps

1. Run `./immediate-actions.sh` to verify environment
2. Execute `./layered-migration.sh` for each layer
3. Monitor progress in migration-workspace/
4. Update CI/CD pipelines
5. Perform integration testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 6 repositories created and populated
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines functional
- [ ] Services deployed to Azure
- [ ] End-to-end tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Documentation complete
