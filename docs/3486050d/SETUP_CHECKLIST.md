# âœ… Setup Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you complete all setup steps:

## Prerequisites
- [ ] GitHub account with admin access
- [ ] Azure subscription with contributor access
- [ ] Docker Desktop installed and running
- [ ] GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- [ ] Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
- [ ] QNAP NAS with Container Station (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed for local development

## Setup Steps
- [ ] Download and extract the migration package
- [ ] Review `01-migration-strategy.md` for understanding
- [ ] Run the master setup script from `05-automation-scripts.md`
- [ ] Verify all 8 repositories were created in GitHub
- [ ] Confirm Azure resource group was created
- [ ] Test local development environment with Docker Compose
- [ ] Make a test commit to trigger the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Verify deployment to QNAP test environment (if configured)
- [ ] Confirm Azure Container Apps are running
- [ ] Check monitoring and alerting configuration

## Post-Setup Configuration
- [ ] Set up custom domain names for production
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Add team members to GitHub repositories
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Document operational procedures
- [ ] Train team on new workflows

## First Migration
- [ ] Choose the first service to migrate (recommend Document Service)
- [ ] Extract service code to its repository
- [ ] Update database connections
- [ ] Test service independently
- [ ] Deploy via CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitor performance and stability
- [ ] Plan next service migration

## Validation
- [ ] All services respond to health checks
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines complete successfully
- [ ] Blue-green deployments work correctly
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show data
- [ ] Alerts trigger correctly
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested
- [ ] Team can develop independently

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs in GitHub Actions workflows
2. Verify all secrets are configured correctly
3. Ensure network connectivity between services
4. Review Azure Resource Group for any failed deployments
5. Check Docker container logs for service-specific issues

## Success Criteria
âœ… All 8 microservices running independently
âœ… CI/CD pipeline from code commit to production
âœ… Blue-green deployments with zero downtime
âœ… Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
âœ… Team can develop and deploy independently
âœ… System performs better than monolith

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You've successfully migrated to microservices!
