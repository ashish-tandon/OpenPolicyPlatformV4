# OpenPolicyPlatform V4 - Monorepo to Microservices Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for migrating the OpenPolicyPlatform V4 from a monorepo architecture to independent microservices repositories with orchestrated CI/CD pipelines. The migration includes automated testing, blue-green deployments across local Docker, QNAP test environments, and Azure production infrastructure.

## Current State Analysis

Based on the repository context (OpenPolicyPlatform for Canadian legislation transparency), the platform likely contains:
- **Frontend Services**: Web interface for policy viewing and interaction
- **API Services**: REST/GraphQL APIs for policy data access
- **Policy Processing Services**: Data ingestion and processing from legislative sources
- **Notification Services**: User alerts and updates
- **Authentication Services**: User management and access control
- **Database Services**: Data persistence and management
- **Analytics Services**: Usage tracking and reporting

## Migration Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Service Independence**: Each service deployable independently
2. **Team Autonomy**: Development teams can work without blocking each other
3. **Scalability**: Individual services scale based on demand
4. **Reliability**: Blue-green deployments minimize downtime
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive automated testing at each stage

### Target Architecture
- **Development**: Local Docker containers
- **QA/Testing**: QNAP Docker environment with Container Station
- **Production**: Azure Container Apps with full orchestration

## Phase 1: Repository Structure Design

### 1.1 New Repository Structure

```
openpolicy-platform/
├── orchestration-repo/              # Central coordination
├── frontend-web/                    # React/Vue web interface
├── api-gateway/                     # API routing and management
├── policy-processor/                # Legislative data processing
├── notification-service/            # User notifications
├── auth-service/                    # Authentication & authorization
├── analytics-service/              # Usage analytics
├── document-service/               # Policy document management
└── shared-libraries/               # Common utilities and types
```

### 1.2 Orchestration Repository Contents

```
orchestration-repo/
├── .github/workflows/              # GitHub Actions workflows
├── infrastructure/                 # Infrastructure as Code
│   ├── local/                      # Docker Compose files
│   ├── qnap/                      # QNAP Container Station configs
│   └── azure/                     # Azure deployment templates
├── scripts/                       # Automation scripts
├── docs/                         # Documentation
└── monitoring/                   # Health checks and monitoring
```

## Phase 2: Service Decomposition Strategy

### 2.1 Decomposition Order (Following Martin Fowler's Guidelines)

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with Document Service (least dependencies)
2. **Extract Data Early**: Separate databases per service
3. **Minimize Dependencies**: Policy Processor before API Gateway
4. **Business Critical Last**: Authentication Service and Frontend last

### 2.2 Service Boundaries

Each service should follow Single Responsibility Principle:

**Document Service**
- Responsible for: Policy document storage, retrieval, versioning
- Database: Document metadata, file references
- APIs: CRUD operations for policy documents

**Policy Processor**  
- Responsible for: Legislative data ingestion, parsing, transformation
- Database: Processing logs, source system mappings
- APIs: Processing triggers, status queries

**Notification Service**
- Responsible for: User alerts, email/SMS delivery, subscription management  
- Database: Notification preferences, delivery logs
- APIs: Subscription management, notification triggers

## Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

### 3.1 Multi-Repository Workflow

```yaml
Trigger Flow:
1. Developer pushes to service repo
2. Service-specific tests run
3. If tests pass, trigger orchestration repo
4. Orchestration repo coordinates:
   - Integration tests
   - Docker image builds
   - Deployment to environments
   - Blue-green traffic switching
```

### 3.2 Environment Progression

```
Developer Workstation (Local Docker)
    ↓
QNAP Test Environment (Docker with Container Station)
    ↓ 
Azure Staging (Container Apps)
    ↓
Azure Production (Container Apps with Blue-Green)
```

### 3.3 Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Each service repository
**Integration Tests**: Orchestration repository
**End-to-End Tests**: Full environment testing
**Performance Tests**: Load testing in QNAP environment
**Security Tests**: Container scanning and vulnerability assessment

## Phase 4: Local Development Environment

### 4.1 Docker Compose Setup

```yaml
# docker-compose.local.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api-gateway:
    build: ../api-gateway
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    depends_on:
      - policy-processor
      - document-service

  policy-processor:
    build: ../policy-processor
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/policies
    depends_on:
      - postgres

  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=policies
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pass
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

### 4.2 Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development**: Developer works on individual service
2. **Local Testing**: Docker Compose brings up full stack
3. **Integration Testing**: Orchestration repo validates service interaction
4. **Pull Request**: Automated tests run before merge

## Phase 5: QNAP Testing Environment  

### 5.1 Container Station Configuration

QNAP Container Station provides Docker orchestration for testing:

```yaml
# qnap-deployment.yml for Container Station
version: '3.8'
services:
  openpolicy-blue:
    image: registry.local/openpolicy:${BLUE_VERSION}
    ports:
      - "8080:3000"
    environment:
      - ENV=blue
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
    networks:
      - openpolicy-network

  openpolicy-green:
    image: registry.local/openpolicy:${GREEN_VERSION}
    ports:
      - "8081:3000"
    environment:
      - ENV=green
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
    networks:
      - openpolicy-network

  nginx-proxy:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - openpolicy-blue
      - openpolicy-green
```

### 5.2 Blue-Green Deployment Process

1. **Blue Environment**: Current production traffic
2. **Green Environment**: New version deployment
3. **Health Checks**: Automated testing in green environment
4. **Traffic Switch**: Nginx configuration update
5. **Monitoring**: Verify green environment stability
6. **Cleanup**: Remove blue environment after validation

## Phase 6: Azure Production Environment

### 6.1 Azure Container Apps Architecture

```yaml
# azure-container-app.bicep
resource containerApp 'Microsoft.App/containerApps@2022-03-01' = {
  name: 'openpolicy-${serviceName}'
  location: location
  properties: {
    managedEnvironmentId: containerEnvironment.id
    configuration: {
      ingress: {
        external: true
        targetPort: 3000
        traffic: [
          {
            revisionName: '${serviceName}-blue'
            weight: 100
          }
        ]
      }
      secrets: [
        {
          name: 'database-connection'
          value: databaseConnectionString
        }
      ]
    }
    template: {
      containers: [
        {
          image: '${acrName}.azurecr.io/${serviceName}:${imageTag}'
          name: serviceName
          env: [
            {
              name: 'DATABASE_URL'
              secretRef: 'database-connection'
            }
          ]
          resources: {
            cpu: '0.5'
            memory: '1.0Gi'
          }
        }
      ]
      scale: {
        minReplicas: 1
        maxReplicas: 10
        rules: [
          {
            name: 'http-rule'
            http: {
              metadata: {
                concurrentRequests: '10'
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Blue-Green Deployment in Azure

Azure Container Apps supports traffic splitting between revisions:

1. **Deploy Green**: New revision with 0% traffic
2. **Validate Green**: Run health checks and smoke tests  
3. **Traffic Split**: Gradually shift traffic (10%, 50%, 100%)
4. **Monitor**: Watch metrics and error rates
5. **Rollback**: Instant traffic switch if issues detected

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Infrastructure setup and first service migration
- **Week 3-4**: Core services migration  
- **Week 5-6**: API layer migration
- **Week 7-8**: Final services and production cutover

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep monolith running in parallel initially
- Feature flags for gradual migration
- Database migration with rollback scripts

### Data Migration
- Implement data synchronization
- Gradual data migration per service
- Validation and integrity checks

### Team Training
- Microservices architecture training
- Docker and Kubernetes workshops  
- CI/CD pipeline management
- Monitoring and troubleshooting

## Conclusion

This migration strategy provides a comprehensive path from monorepo to microservices while maintaining system stability and enabling team independence. The phased approach minimizes risk while delivering incremental value at each stage.

Key success factors:
1. **Start Small**: Begin with low-risk, decoupled services
2. **Automate Early**: CI/CD pipeline from day one
3. **Monitor Everything**: Comprehensive observability
4. **Plan for Rollback**: Always have an exit strategy
5. **Team Alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand the process

The blue-green deployment strategy across local Docker, QNAP testing, and Azure production provides robust validation at each stage while minimizing downtime and risk to the OpenPolicyPlatform users.
