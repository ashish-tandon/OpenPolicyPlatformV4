## 🚀 Quick Start (15 minutes to complete setup)

### Prerequisites:
- GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- Azure CLI authenticated (`az login`)
- Docker Desktop running
- QNAP NAS with Container Station (optional)

### One-Command Setup:
```bash
# Download and run the master setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup-migration.sh

./scripts/setup-migration.sh \
  "your-github-username" \
  "your-azure-subscription-id" \
  "your-qnap-ip-address" \
  "prod"
```

This will automatically:
✅ Create 8 GitHub repositories with CI/CD pipelines
✅ Deploy Azure infrastructure (Container Apps, databases, monitoring)
✅ Configure QNAP Container Station for testing
✅ Set up blue-green deployment automation
✅ Configure monitoring, logging, and alerting

## 🏗️ Target Architecture

```
🎭 ORCHESTRATION REPO (Central Coordination)
    ↓
📦 8 SERVICE REPOSITORIES
├── Frontend Web (React/Vue interface)
├── API Gateway (Request routing & management) 
├── Policy Processor (Legislative data processing)
├── Document Service (Policy document management)
├── Notification Service (User alerts & communications)
├── Auth Service (Authentication & authorization)
├── Analytics Service (Usage tracking & reporting)
└── Shared Libraries (Common utilities)

🚀 DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
Local Docker → QNAP Test → Azure Production
```
