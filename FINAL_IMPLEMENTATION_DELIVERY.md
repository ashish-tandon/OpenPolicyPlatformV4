### 📁 5. What's Ready to Use NOW

1. **Run the Azure Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd migration-repos
   ./setup-azure-resources.sh
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub** (requires GitHub authentication):
   ```bash
   cd migration-repos
   for repo in openpolicy-*; do
       cd $repo
       gh repo create ashish-tandon/$repo --public --push
       cd ..
   done
   ```

3. **Deploy Locally**:
   ```bash
   cd migration-repos/openpolicy-infrastructure
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### 🎯 6. Key Deliverables

| Deliverable | Status | Location |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| 6 Git Repositories | ✅ CREATED | `migration-repos/openpolicy-*` |
| CI/CD Pipelines | ✅ CREATED | Each repo's `.github/workflows/` |
| Docker Configurations | ✅ CREATED | Each repo's `docker-compose.yml` |
| Azure Deployment | ✅ CREATED | `k8s/azure-deployment.bicep` |
| Service Migrations | ✅ COMPLETED | `src/services/` in each repo |
| Health Monitoring | ✅ IMPLEMENTED | All services have `/healthz` |
