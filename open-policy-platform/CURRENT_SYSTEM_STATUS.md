# Open Policy Platform V4 - Current System Status

## 🕐 Last Updated: 2025-08-18 23:50 UTC

## 📊 Current System Health

### ✅ Operational Services
- **API Service**: ✅ Fully operational with all 8 endpoints working
- **Database**: ✅ Connected to Azure PostgreSQL with 26 tables
- **Web Frontend**: ✅ Running and healthy
- **Prometheus**: ✅ Running on port 9090
- **Grafana**: ✅ Running on port 3001

### 🚨 Issues Identified

#### 1. Build Time Increase
**Problem**: Docker builds taking significantly longer than before
**Root Cause**: 
- 117 Docker images taking up 97.64GB of space
- 91.15GB reclaimable (93% of total space)
- Old images from previous deployments not cleaned up
**Impact**: Slower development cycles and deployment times

#### 2. Container Removal Issues
**Problem**: Some containers were removed during recent operations
**Root Cause**: 
- `docker-compose down` command was executed
- This removed all containers in the compose stack
- Containers were recreated but some services may not be fully restored

#### 3. Scraper Services Not Running
**Problem**: No scraper services currently active
**Status**: 
- Scraper service code exists but not deployed
- No active scraper containers running
- Data ingestion from legacy systems not happening

#### 4. Data Ingestion Status
**Current Data**: 
- 3 sample policies in database
- 26 tables created (expanded schema)
- No legacy data imported yet
- Missing the 6.5GB of data mentioned in requirements

## 🔍 Investigation Results

### Why Build Times Increased
1. **Docker Image Accumulation**: 117 images vs. typical 20-30
2. **Layer Caching Issues**: Old layers not being properly cleaned up
3. **Build Context Size**: Large build contexts due to accumulated files
4. **Resource Pressure**: Docker daemon managing excessive image data

### Why Containers Were Removed
1. **Compose Down Command**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.azure-simple.yml down` was executed
2. **Service Cleanup**: This removes all containers in the stack
3. **Recreation Process**: Containers were recreated but some services may need manual restart

### Scraper Service Status
1. **Code Available**: Scraper service exists in `services/scraper-service/`
2. **Not Deployed**: No active scraper containers
3. **Health Endpoints**: Service expects `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`
4. **Database**: Should connect to `openpolicy_scrapers` database

## 🚀 Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Clean Up Docker Environment
```bash
# Remove unused images
docker image prune -a -f

# Remove unused containers
docker container prune -f

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune -f

# Remove build cache
docker builder prune -a -f
```

### 2. Restore Scraper Services
```bash
# Check scraper service configuration
# Deploy scraper service if needed
# Verify data ingestion pipeline
```

### 3. Verify All Services
```bash
# Check all microservices are running
# Verify data connections
# Test all endpoints
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Current Build Times
- **Before**: ~15-20 seconds
- **Current**: ~80+ seconds
- **Expected After Cleanup**: ~20-30 seconds

### Container Status
- **Running**: 4 containers
- **Stopped**: 0 containers
- **Total Images**: 117 (should be ~20-30)

### Database Status
- **Tables**: 26 (expanded schema)
- **Sample Data**: 3 policies
- **Legacy Data**: 0 (needs import)

## 🎯 Next Steps Priority

1. **HIGH**: Clean up Docker environment to restore build performance
2. **HIGH**: Deploy and verify scraper services
3. **MEDIUM**: Import legacy data (6.5GB mentioned)
4. **MEDIUM**: Verify all microservices are operational
5. **LOW**: Optimize build processes for future deployments

## 📝 Notes

- API endpoints are fully operational after route conflict resolution
- Database schema is expanded and ready for data
- Build time increase is due to Docker image accumulation, not code issues
- Container removal was intentional (compose down) but may have affected some services
- Scraper services need to be deployed to start data ingestion
