# üìä ADR-004: Dashboard Service Implementation

## üìÖ **Date**: 2025-08-17
## üîç **Status**: PROPOSED - Ready for Implementation
## üö® **Type**: Service Implementation Decision
## üìã **Decision**: Dashboard Service Architecture and Implementation

---

## üéØ **CONTEXT**

As we continue with Phase 4 of our microservices implementation, we need to implement the **Dashboard Service** which will handle all dashboard-related functionality including data aggregation, analytics, visualization, and real-time metrics.

This service is essential for providing insights, analytics, and data visualization across the Open Policy Platform. It must integrate seamlessly with other services while maintaining our established architectural principles.

---

## üö® **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **Current State**
- Dashboard functionality is currently integrated in the main backend
- No dedicated service for data aggregation and analytics
- Limited real-time data capabilities
- No service isolation for dashboard operations

### **Required Capabilities**
1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect and aggregate data from multiple services
2. **Analytics Engine**: Process and analyze data for insights
3. **Visualization API**: Provide data for charts and graphs
4. **Real-time Updates**: Live data updates and notifications
5. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable dashboard layouts
6. **Performance Metrics**: System and business performance tracking
7. **Export Capabilities**: Data export in various formats

---

## üîç **CONSIDERED OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Full-Featured Analytics Service**
- **Approach**: Complete analytics service with all functionality
- **Pros**: 
  - Full feature set
  - Complete service isolation
  - Maximum scalability
- **Cons**: 
  - Higher complexity
  - Longer implementation time
  - More testing required

### **Option 2: Core Dashboard Service with Extensions**
- **Approach**: Core dashboard service with extension points
- **Pros**: 
  - Balanced complexity
  - Extensible architecture
  - Faster initial implementation
- **Cons**: 
  - May need refactoring later
  - Extension points add complexity

### **Option 3: Minimal Dashboard Service with Growth**
- **Approach**: Start with essential functionality, grow incrementally
- **Pros**: 
  - Fast implementation
  - Learn from usage
  - Lower risk
- **Cons**: 
  - May need frequent updates
  - Potential architecture drift

5. **Architecture Compliant**: Follows our microservices principles

#### **Core Functionality**
1. **Data Aggregation**: Collect data from other services
2. **Basic Analytics**: Simple calculations and aggregations
3. **Metrics API**: Provide metrics for visualization
4. **Dashboard Data**: Core dashboard data endpoints
5. **Health and Monitoring**: Standard service endpoints
6. **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
7. **Caching**: Basic data caching for performance

#### **Extension Points**
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Complex statistical analysis
2. **Real-time Streaming**: Live data updates
3. **Custom Dashboards**: User-configurable layouts
4. **Machine Learning**: Predictive analytics
5. **Data Export**: Multiple export formats

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT**

### **Positive Impacts**
1. **Service Isolation**: Dashboard functionality properly isolated
2. **Scalability**: Can scale independently of other services
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update
4. **Testing**: Isolated testing and validation
5. **Deployment**: Independent deployment and rollback

### **Required Changes**
1. **Service Implementation**: New dashboard service
2. **API Gateway**: Update routing configuration
3. **Data Integration**: Integration with other services
4. **Caching Layer**: Data caching infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: Service documentation and API specs

### **Risk Mitigation**
