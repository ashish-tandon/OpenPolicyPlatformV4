# üìä ADR-007: Reporting Service Implementation

## üìÖ **Date**: 2025-08-17
## üîç **Status**: PROPOSED - Ready for Implementation
## üö® **Type**: Service Implementation Decision
## üìã **Decision**: Reporting Service Architecture and Implementation

---

## üéØ **CONTEXT**

As we continue with Phase 4 of our microservices implementation, we need to implement the **Reporting Service** which will handle all advanced reporting, data export, custom queries, and report generation across the Open Policy Platform.

This service is essential for providing comprehensive reporting capabilities, data export functionality, and custom query execution. It must integrate seamlessly with other services while maintaining our established architectural principles.

---

## üö® **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **Current State**
- Reporting functionality is currently integrated in the main backend
- No dedicated service for advanced reporting and data export
- Limited custom query capabilities
- No service isolation for reporting operations

### **Required Capabilities**
1. **Advanced Reporting**: Custom report generation and templates
2. **Data Export**: Multiple format export (CSV, JSON, PDF, Excel)
3. **Custom Queries**: SQL-like query execution and results
4. **Report Scheduling**: Automated report generation and delivery
5. **Template Management**: Report template creation and management
6. **Data Visualization**: Chart and graph data preparation
7. **Report Distribution**: Email, API, and file-based distribution

---

## üîç **CONSIDERED OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Full-Featured Reporting Platform**
- **Approach**: Complete reporting platform with all functionality
- **Pros**: 
  - Full feature set
  - Complete service isolation
  - Maximum scalability
- **Cons**: 
  - Higher complexity
  - Longer implementation time
  - More testing required

### **Option 2: Core Reporting Service with Extensions**
- **Approach**: Core reporting service with extension points
- **Pros**: 
  - Balanced complexity
  - Extensible architecture
  - Faster initial implementation
- **Cons**: 
  - May need refactoring later
  - Extension points add complexity

### **Option 3: Minimal Reporting Service with Growth**
- **Approach**: Start with essential functionality, grow incrementally
- **Pros**: 
  - Fast implementation
  - Learn from usage
  - Lower risk
- **Cons**: 
  - May need frequent updates
  - Potential architecture drift

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION**

### **Option 2: Core Reporting Service with Extensions**

We recommend implementing a **Core Reporting Service** with clear extension points for future growth.

#### **Why This Option?**
1. **Balanced Approach**: Provides essential functionality without over-engineering
2. **Extensible**: Can grow with business needs
3. **Maintainable**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
4. **Testable**: Easier to test and validate
5. **Architecture Compliant**: Follows our microservices principles

#### **Core Functionality**
1. **Basic Reporting**: Report generation and template management
2. **Data Export**: CSV, JSON, and basic Excel export
3. **Custom Queries**: Basic query execution and results
4. **Report Scheduling**: Basic scheduling and delivery
5. **Template Management**: Report template CRUD operations
6. **Health and Monitoring**: Standard service endpoints
7. **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

#### **Extension Points**
1. **Advanced Export**: PDF generation, advanced Excel formats
2. **Complex Queries**: Advanced SQL, aggregation, and joins
3. **Advanced Scheduling**: Complex scheduling rules and conditions
4. **Advanced Templates**: Dynamic templates with variables
5. **Report Analytics**: Report usage analytics and insights

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT**

### **Positive Impacts**
1. **Service Isolation**: Reporting functionality properly isolated
2. **Scalability**: Can scale independently of other services
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update
4. **Testing**: Isolated testing and validation
5. **Deployment**: Independent deployment and rollback

### **Required Changes**
1. **Service Implementation**: New reporting service
2. **API Gateway**: Update routing configuration
3. **Data Integration**: Integration with other services
4. **Template Storage**: Report template storage infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: Service documentation and API specs

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Start with core, add features gradually
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing at each stage
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of all functionality
4. **Monitoring**: Proper monitoring and alerting
5. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to rollback if issues arise
