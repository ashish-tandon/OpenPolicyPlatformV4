# üìÅ ADR-003: Files Service Implementation

## üìÖ **Date**: 2025-08-17
## üîç **Status**: PROPOSED - Ready for Implementation
## üö® **Type**: Service Implementation Decision
## üìã **Decision**: Files Service Architecture and Implementation

---

## üéØ **CONTEXT**

As we continue with Phase 4 of our microservices implementation, we need to implement the **Files Service** which will handle all file-related functionality including upload, download, storage, versioning, and metadata management.

This service is essential for document management, policy attachments, and file sharing across the Open Policy Platform. It must integrate seamlessly with other services while maintaining our established architectural principles.

---

## üö® **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **Current State**
- File functionality is currently integrated in the main backend
- No dedicated service for file management
- Limited file storage and versioning capabilities
- No service isolation for file operations

### **Required Capabilities**
1. **File Upload/Download**: Secure file transfer operations
2. **Storage Management**: File storage and organization
3. **Version Control**: File versioning and history
4. **Metadata Management**: File information and categorization
5. **Access Control**: File permissions and security
6. **Search and Discovery**: File search and filtering
7. **Integration Hooks**: Service-to-service file operations

---

## üîç **CONSIDERED OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Full-Featured File Service**
- **Approach**: Complete file service with all functionality
- **Pros**: 
  - Full feature set
  - Complete service isolation
  - Maximum scalability
- **Cons**: 
  - Higher complexity
  - Longer implementation time
  - More testing required

### **Option 2: Core File Service with Extensions**
- **Approach**: Core file service with extension points
- **Pros**: 
  - Balanced complexity
  - Extensible architecture
  - Faster initial implementation
- **Cons**: 
  - May need refactoring later
  - Extension points add complexity

### **Option 3: Minimal File Service with Growth**
- **Approach**: Start with essential functionality, grow incrementally
- **Pros**: 
  - Fast implementation
  - Learn from usage
  - Lower risk
- **Cons**: 
  - May need frequent updates
  - Potential architecture drift

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION**

### **Option 2: Core File Service with Extensions**

We recommend implementing a **Core Files Service** with clear extension points for future growth.

#### **Why This Option?**
1. **Balanced Approach**: Provides essential functionality without over-engineering
2. **Extensible**: Can grow with business needs
3. **Maintainable**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
4. **Testable**: Easier to test and validate
5. **Architecture Compliant**: Follows our microservices principles

#### **Core Functionality**
1. **File CRUD**: Basic file create, read, update, delete operations
2. **Upload/Download**: File transfer with validation
3. **Metadata Management**: File information and categorization
4. **Basic Versioning**: File version tracking
5. **Access Control**: Basic permission management
6. **Health and Monitoring**: Standard service endpoints
7. **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

#### **Extension Points**
1. **Advanced Storage**: Multiple storage backends
2. **Advanced Versioning**: Complex version control
3. **Search and Discovery**: Full-text search capabilities
4. **Integration APIs**: External system integration
5. **Analytics**: File usage analytics and insights

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT**

### **Positive Impacts**
1. **Service Isolation**: File functionality properly isolated
2. **Scalability**: Can scale independently of other services
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update
4. **Testing**: Isolated testing and validation
5. **Deployment**: Independent deployment and rollback

### **Required Changes**
1. **Service Implementation**: New files service
2. **API Gateway**: Update routing configuration
3. **Storage Infrastructure**: File storage system
4. **Integration Points**: Update other services to use new service
5. **Documentation**: Service documentation and API specs

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Start with core, add features gradually
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing at each stage
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of all functionality
4. **Monitoring**: Proper monitoring and alerting
5. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to rollback if issues arise
