# üèõÔ∏è ADR-002: Representatives Service Implementation

## üìÖ **Date**: 2025-08-17
## üîç **Status**: PROPOSED - Ready for Implementation
## üö® **Type**: Service Implementation Decision
## üìã **Decision**: Representatives Service Architecture and Implementation

---

## üéØ **CONTEXT**

As we continue with Phase 4 of our microservices implementation, we need to implement the **Representatives Service** which will handle all representative-related functionality including profiles, contact information, roles, and relationships.

This service is critical for the core business logic of the Open Policy Platform and must integrate seamlessly with other services while maintaining our established architectural principles.

---

## üö® **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

### **Current State**
- Representatives functionality is currently integrated in the main backend
- No dedicated service for representative management
- Limited scalability and maintainability
- No service isolation for representative operations

### **Required Capabilities**
1. **Representative Management**: CRUD operations for representatives
2. **Profile Management**: Personal and professional information
3. **Contact Information**: Multiple contact methods and addresses
4. **Role Management**: Political roles, committees, positions
5. **Relationship Mapping**: Connections to policies, votes, debates
6. **Search and Filtering**: Advanced search capabilities
7. **Data Validation**: Proper input validation and sanitization

---

## üîç **CONSIDERED OPTIONS**

### **Option 1: Full-Service Implementation**
- **Approach**: Complete representatives service with all functionality
- **Pros**: 
  - Full feature set
  - Complete service isolation
  - Maximum scalability
- **Cons**: 
  - Higher complexity
  - Longer implementation time
  - More testing required

### **Option 2: Core Service with Extensions**
- **Approach**: Core representatives service with extension points
- **Pros**: 
  - Balanced complexity
  - Extensible architecture
  - Faster initial implementation
- **Cons**: 
  - May need refactoring later
  - Extension points add complexity

### **Option 3: Minimal Service with Growth**
- **Approach**: Start with essential functionality, grow incrementally
- **Pros**: 
  - Fast implementation
  - Learn from usage
  - Lower risk
- **Cons**: 
  - May need frequent updates
  - Potential architecture drift

---

## üéØ **RECOMMENDED SOLUTION**

### **Option 2: Core Service with Extensions**

We recommend implementing a **Core Representatives Service** with clear extension points for future growth.

#### **Why This Option?**
1. **Balanced Approach**: Provides essential functionality without over-engineering
2. **Extensible**: Can grow with business needs
3. **Maintainable**: Clear boundaries and responsibilities
4. **Testable**: Easier to test and validate
5. **Architecture Compliant**: Follows our microservices principles

#### **Core Functionality**
1. **Representative CRUD**: Basic create, read, update, delete operations
2. **Profile Management**: Essential profile information
3. **Contact Information**: Primary contact methods
4. **Role Management**: Basic role and position tracking
5. **Health and Monitoring**: Standard service endpoints
6. **Data Validation**: Input validation and sanitization

#### **Extension Points**
1. **Advanced Search**: Full-text search and filtering
2. **Relationship Mapping**: Complex relationship tracking
3. **Analytics**: Representative analytics and insights
4. **Integration Hooks**: External system integration points

---

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT**

### **Positive Impacts**
1. **Service Isolation**: Representatives functionality properly isolated
2. **Scalability**: Can scale independently of other services
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and update
4. **Testing**: Isolated testing and validation
5. **Deployment**: Independent deployment and rollback

### **Required Changes**
1. **Service Implementation**: New representatives service
2. **API Gateway**: Update routing configuration
3. **Database Schema**: Representatives data model
4. **Integration Points**: Update other services to use new service
5. **Documentation**: Service documentation and API specs

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Start with core, add features gradually
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough testing at each stage
3. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of all functionality
4. **Monitoring**: Proper monitoring and alerting
5. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to rollback if issues arise
