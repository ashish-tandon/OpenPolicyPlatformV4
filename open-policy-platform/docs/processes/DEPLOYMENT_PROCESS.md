# Deployment Process

## Overview
This document defines the complete deployment pipeline for the Open Policy Platform, including automated CI/CD, manual deployment procedures, and comprehensive error tracking.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Deployment Checklist
**BEFORE ANY DEPLOYMENT**, you MUST complete the [Deployment Checklist](DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md). This checklist ensures:
- Architecture compliance validation
- Error tracking system readiness
- Resource availability confirmation
- Stakeholder approval
- Emergency procedures readiness

**Failure to complete the checklist will result in deployment failure and potential system instability.**

## Deployment Pipeline Overview

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
The platform uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, building, and deployment:

1. **Code Push Trigger**: Automatic deployment on push to main branch
2. **Automated Testing Stages**: Unit tests, integration tests, security scans
3. **Automated Build**: Docker image building and pushing to registry
4. **Automated Deployment**: Kubernetes deployment via kubectl and Helm
5. **Health Verification**: Automated health checks and rollback triggers

### Manual Deployment Procedures

#### Development Environment
- **Prerequisites**: Docker, Python 3.11+, Node.js 20+
- **Steps**: 
  1. Clone repository and setup environment
  2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
  3. Verify services health
- **Verification**: Health endpoints, smoke tests

#### Staging Environment
- **Prerequisites**: Kubernetes cluster, Helm 3.0+
- **Steps**:
  1. Deploy via Helm charts
  2. Run integration tests
  3. Performance validation
- **Verification**: Full test suite, load testing

#### Production Environment
- **Prerequisites**: Production Kubernetes cluster, monitoring setup
- **Steps**:
  1. Blue-green deployment strategy
  2. Gradual traffic shifting
  3. Full monitoring validation
- **Verification**: Business metrics, performance SLAs

## Container Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run services
docker-compose up -d --build

# Verify services
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

### Kubernetes/Helm Deployment
```bash
# Deploy via Helm
helm install openpolicy ./deploy/helm/open-policy-platform

# Upgrade existing deployment
helm upgrade openpolicy ./deploy/helm/open-policy-platform

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n openpolicy
kubectl get services -n openpolicy
```

## Deployment Validation

### Health Checks
- **Service Health**: `/healthz` endpoints for all services
- **Database Connectivity**: Connection pool status
- **Dependencies**: External service availability
- **Performance**: Response time monitoring

### Functionality Testing
- **API Endpoints**: All CRUD operations
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation
- **Data Flow**: End-to-end workflows
- **Integration**: Service communication

### Performance Validation
- **Response Times**: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Throughput**: Handle expected load
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk monitoring
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling triggers

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures (> 3 consecutive)
- Performance degradation (> 50% response time increase)
- Error rate spike (> 5% error rate)

### Manual Rollback Process
1. **Assessment**: Identify rollback reason
2. **Preparation**: Backup current state
3. **Execution**: Revert to previous version
4. **Verification**: Confirm system stability
5. **Documentation**: Record incident details

### Rollback Commands
```bash
# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/[service-name] -n openpolicy

# Helm rollback
helm rollback openpolicy [revision-number]

# Docker rollback
docker-compose down
git checkout [previous-commit]
docker-compose up -d
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate Monitoring (First 30 minutes)
- Service health status
- Error rate monitoring
- Performance metrics
- User experience metrics

### Extended Monitoring (24 hours)
- Business metrics validation
- Performance trend analysis
- Resource utilization patterns
- User feedback collection

## ERROR TRACKING AND ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT

### Deployment Error Tracking System

#### 1. Error Categories
- **Configuration Errors**: Environment variables, config files
- **Dependency Errors**: Service dependencies, external services
- **Resource Errors**: Memory, CPU, disk space
- **Network Errors**: Connectivity, timeouts, DNS
- **Security Errors**: Authentication, authorization, certificates
- **Performance Errors**: Slow responses, timeouts, bottlenecks

#### 2. Error Logging Requirements
All deployment processes MUST log errors with:
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format
- **Error Code**: Standardized error codes
- **Severity**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Context**: Service name, environment, deployment stage
- **Stack Trace**: Full error details for debugging
- **Impact Assessment**: User impact, business impact

#### 3. Error Tracking Database
```sql
-- Error tracking table structure
CREATE TABLE deployment_errors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    service_name VARCHAR(100),
    environment VARCHAR(50),
    deployment_stage VARCHAR(100),
    error_code VARCHAR(50),
    severity VARCHAR(20),
    error_message TEXT,
    stack_trace TEXT,
    user_impact TEXT,
    business_impact TEXT,
    resolution_notes TEXT,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_by VARCHAR(100)
);
```

### Architecture Alignment Validation

#### 1. Pre-Deployment Architecture Check
**MANDATORY**: Before any deployment, validate:
- [ ] Service follows microservices architecture principles
- [ ] Service has proper health check endpoints
- [ ] Service implements centralized logging
- [ ] Service has proper monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Service configuration follows standards
- [ ] Service dependencies are documented
- [ ] Service ports are correctly configured
- [ ] Service has proper error handling

#### 2. Architecture Compliance Checklist
```bash
# Run architecture compliance check
./scripts/check-architecture-compliance.sh [service-name]

# Expected output:
# ✅ Service follows microservices architecture
# ✅ Health check endpoints implemented
# ✅ Centralized logging configured
# ✅ Monitoring endpoints available
# ✅ Configuration standards followed
# ✅ Dependencies documented
# ✅ Ports correctly configured
# ✅ Error handling implemented
```

#### 3. Architecture Deviation Detection
**AUTOMATIC**: System continuously monitors for:
- Services not following microservices pattern
- Missing health check endpoints
- Inconsistent logging patterns
- Configuration deviations
- Port conflicts
- Missing monitoring

#### 4. Architecture Alignment Reports
Generated after each deployment:
- **Compliance Score**: Percentage of architecture requirements met
- **Deviation List**: Specific architecture violations
- **Recommendation List**: Actions to improve alignment
- **Risk Assessment**: Impact of deviations on system stability
