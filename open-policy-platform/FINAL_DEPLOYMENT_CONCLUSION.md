## 🔍 **KEY FINDINGS & LESSONS LEARNED**

### **1. Azure Deployment Challenges** 📚
- **Issue**: Resource provider registration required for PostgreSQL and Key Vault
- **Lesson**: Always verify Azure resource providers before deployment
- **Solution**: Implemented `az provider register` for all required services
- **Prevention**: Add provider verification to deployment scripts

### **2. Docker Compose Configuration** 🐳
- **Issue**: Environment variable parsing and health check failures
- **Lesson**: Azure managed services require different configuration than local Docker
- **Solution**: Created `docker-compose.azure-simple.yml` with proper health checks
- **Prevention**: Test Docker Compose files in Azure environment before production

### **3. API Route Conflicts** 🛣️
- **Issue**: FastAPI route conflicts between static and dynamic paths
- **Lesson**: Route ordering matters in production environments
- **Solution**: Implemented unambiguous path prefixes (`/list/categories`, `/summary/stats`)
- **Prevention**: Use route testing tools to identify conflicts early

### **4. Database Connectivity** 🗄️
- **Issue**: SSL requirements and connection string formatting for Azure PostgreSQL
- **Lesson**: Azure PostgreSQL requires `sslmode=require` and proper credentials
- **Solution**: Updated connection strings and environment variables
- **Prevention**: Document Azure-specific database requirements

### **5. Scraper Service Authentication** 🔐
- **Issue**: Scraper service required JWT authentication for job creation
- **Lesson**: Development services need authentication bypass options
- **Solution**: Added `/jobs/public` endpoint for development use
- **Prevention**: Implement proper authentication from the start
