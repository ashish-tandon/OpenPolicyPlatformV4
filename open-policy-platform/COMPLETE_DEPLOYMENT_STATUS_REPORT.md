- **api-gateway** (8021) - Go-based API gateway - **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**
- **mcp** (8022) - Model Context Protocol service - **NEEDS INVESTIGATION**

## üîß Systematic Fixes Applied

### 1. Port Configuration Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Many services had hardcoded ports in Dockerfiles that conflicted with Docker Compose port mappings.

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated all service Dockerfiles to use `EXPOSE 8000`
- Changed all `CMD` instructions to use port `8000`
- Fixed hardcoded ports in application code (e.g., docker-monitor)

**Services Fixed:**
- auth, policy, search, data-management, analytics
- config, dashboard, files, integration, legacy-django
- plotly, mobile-api, monitoring, notification, reporting
- representatives, workflow, committees, debates, votes
- docker-monitor

### 2. Health Check Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Docker health checks were failing because containers didn't have `curl` installed.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `curl` installation to all service Dockerfiles
- Updated health check commands to use `curl -f http://localhost:8000/health`

**Services Fixed:**
- All 23 healthy services now have working health checks

### 3. Python Import Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Some services had missing `typing` imports causing `NameError`.

**Solution Applied:**
- Added `Dict, Any` to `typing` imports in:
  - committees-service
  - debates-service
  - votes-service
  - mcp-service

## üö® Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. Main API Service (8000)
**Status:** Unhealthy  
**Impact:** Critical - affects all dependent services  
**Next Steps:** Investigate logs, check database connectivity, verify environment variables

### 2. API Gateway (8021)
**Status:** Unhealthy  
**Impact:** High - affects service-to-service communication  
**Next Steps:** Check Go service logs, verify binary compilation, check port binding

### 3. MCP Service (8022)
**Status:** Unhealthy  
**Impact:** Medium - affects AI/ML integration capabilities  
**Next Steps:** Check Python service logs, verify dependencies, check port configuration

## üìä Deployment Metrics

- **Total Services:** 26
- **Healthy Services:** 23 (88.5%)
- **Unhealthy Services:** 3 (11.5%)
- **Services with Health Checks:** 23 (100% of healthy services)
- **Services with Correct Ports:** 23 (100% of healthy services)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Investigate Main API Service (8000)**
   - Check container logs for startup errors
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check environment variable configuration

2. **Debug API Gateway (8021)**
