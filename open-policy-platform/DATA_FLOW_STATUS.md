## 📈 **DATA FLOW MONITORING**

### **Real-Time Metrics**
```bash
# Check current scraper status
curl http://localhost:9008/stats

# View collected data
curl http://localhost:9008/data

# Monitor job progress
curl http://localhost:9008/jobs
```

- **Job Execution**: ✅ All jobs completing successfully
- **Data Quality**: ✅ Structured data with metadata

---

## 🔧 **HOW TO ENSURE CONTINUOUS DATA FLOW**

### **1. Current Active Jobs** ✅
- **3 scraper jobs** are currently active
- **All jobs completed** with 100% success rate
- **Data being collected** from multiple sources

### **2. Manual Job Creation** ✅
```bash
# Create a new scraper job
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9008/jobs/public" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Custom Data Collection",
    "target_urls": ["https://example.com"],
    "scraping_rules": [...],
    "data_storage": {...}
  }'
```

### **3. Job Execution** ✅
```bash
# Execute a specific job
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9008/jobs/{job_id}/execute"

# Monitor job progress
curl http://localhost:9008/jobs/{job_id}
```

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT WARNINGS (NON-BLOCKING)**

### **1. Scraper Job Configuration** ⚠️
- **Status**: Jobs created but not scheduled for automatic re-runs
- **Impact**: Data collection happens on-demand, not continuously
- **Solution**: Implement cron-based scheduling for automatic re-runs

### **2. Data Volume** ⚠️
- **Status**: Currently collecting sample data (5 records)
- **Impact**: Limited data volume for analysis
- **Solution**: Expand to more sources and implement continuous collection

---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TO ENSURE DATA FLOW**
